# Approximating-Irrational-Numbers
There are multiple ways to approximate irrational numbers such as the square root of 2. The first is simply guessing and checking, using brute-force to get the answer (this is very inefficient). The second is Newton's method, which involves using derivatives to get a recursion which approaches an irrational constant as you recurse through again and again (MIT, 2015). The third involves an infinite series of fractions (Rusczyk & Lehoczky, 2017). Why do we need to approximate these? you may ask. They are very applicable in genetic sequencing (Yau et.al, n.d.) and cryptography. The approximation of algebraic numbers can even be applied to COVID-19! The goal is to find a way to optimize this approximation, be it creating an entirely new way, or comparing current methods.
